## Current WIP
- Fixed bug causing the music toggle to not take full effect until the game is restarted.


## Nov 04, 2022

- Each puzzle now has a "work area" that may be smaller than the full circuit area, leaving some non-editable margins around the outside.  This keeps you from clobbering the input/output pads.
- Added a Music On/Off switch in the Options screen.
- Added chapters 13-14.
