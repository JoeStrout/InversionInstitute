This is the development project for **Inversion Institute**.

Inversion Institute is a logic/puzzle game.  You play as a young initiate at the mystical **Inversion Institute**, where you are introduced to "Magic Ink" — an alchemical substance that can be used to efficiently draw logic gates and circuits that really work!  Working with the other characters at the Institute, you learn to apply this ability in ways that really are magical.  Perhaps, using this ink, you will one day invent the machine that will change the world forever.

## Platforms

Inversion Institute runs on Windows, Mac, and Linux.  The current plan is to distribute it mainly through [Steam](https://joestrout.itch.io/inversion-institute).

## Status

This project was started in August 2022.  So, obviously, it's in the very early stages.

Check back frequently as the game develops!

## Toolchain

Inversion Institute is written in [MiniScript](https://miniscript.org).  Currently it runs in [Mini Micro](https://miniscript.org/MiniMicro), but before we release to Steam, we'll probably port it over to [Soda](https://github.com/JoeStrout/soda).

The circuit simulation is based on the [Pixel Logic Circuit Simulator](https://github.com/JoeStrout/pixelLogic/) (which has a more generous license -- share and enjoy!).
