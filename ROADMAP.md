# Inversion Institute Roadmap
## or, "Things to Do List"

### Editor
- add work boundaries/margins, which the user can drag in to get a more compact space (determining position on the world-result histogram)
- make zoom (scroll wheel) either work, or disable it entirely

### Cut Scenes
- add fade in/out when transitioning to/from cut scenes

### Simulator

### Title Screen
- add an Options panel that lets you change your name and pronouns, and maybe audio settings

### General
- prepare additional fonts (small, italic, etc.) as needed
- further improve the minimicro-pro fonts (shorten width of `'`, etc.)
- add sound effects and background music

### Script Notes
1. Introduction: meet Alicia; learn about crossings and not gates).
1. End of Recess: help a teacher signal his children to come back inside.  (Use a double-not gate to make a signal diode.)
1. Oarley's Children: Alicia tells of Ms. Oarley, who needs the night light to light up when either of her children request it, but neither should be able to turn it off if the other wants it on. (Two diodes feeding an OR gate.)
1. 0/1 Display: Make a 1-bit numeric display, shows 0 when input is low and 1 when it is high.
1. Andi's Gate: Meet Baab; help him make a circuit that opens Andi Anderson's gate when BOTH guards press their control pads. (2-input AND gate.)
1. Majority Rule: (Make a 3-input majority gate.)
1. (Make a latch with reset.)
1. Quiz Game: (4 inputs, latch the output for the first to go high and lock out all the others.)
1. (Make an XOR gate.)
1. (Make a 4-bit, 1-digit hexadecimal display.)
