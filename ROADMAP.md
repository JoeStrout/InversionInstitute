# Inversion Institute Roadmap
## or, "Things to Do List"

### Editor
- shift editor paint area up a bit, leaving room for tool help below
- add editor functions **F**lip and **R**otate (with help) when pasting
- make Line tool create crossings when Shift key is held
- add support for "objectives" supplied by the chapter scene

### Cut Scenes
- add fade in/out when transitioning to/from cut scenes

### Simulator
- two coupled not-gates initially oscillate, until some external input (or mouse click) sets one of them; they are balanced in an unstable state because of the perfectly regular update pattern we use.  Need to find some way to break that symmetry.

### General
- fix Georgia font to eliminate dark shadow on anti-aliasing pixels
- prepare additional fonts (small, italic, etc.) as needed


### Script Notes
1. Introduction: meet Alicia; learn about crossings and not gates).
1. End of Recess: help a teacher signal his children to come back inside.  (Use a double-not gate to make a signal diode.)
1. Oarley's Children: Alicia tells of Ms. Oarley, who needs the night light to light up when either of her children request it, but neither should be able to turn it off if the other wants it on. (Two diodes feeding an OR gate.)
1. (Make a 2-input AND gate.)
1. Majority Rule: (Make a 3-input majority gate.)
1. (Make a latch with reset.)
1. Quiz Game: (4 inputs, latch the output for the first to go high and lock out all the others.)
