# Inversion Institute Roadmap
## or, "Things to Do List"

### Editor
- shift editor paint area up a bit, leaving room for tool help below
- add editor functions **F**lip and **R**otate (with help) when pasting
- make Line tool create crossings when Shift key is held
- add support for "objectives" supplied by the chapter scene

### Cut Scenes
- add fade in/out when transitioning to/from cut scenes

### Simulator
- two coupled not-gates initially oscillate, until some external input (or mouse click) sets one of them; they are balanced in an unstable state because of the perfectly regular update pattern we use.  Need to find some way to break that symmetry.

### General
- fix Georgia font to eliminate dark shadow on anti-aliasing pixels
- prepare additional fonts (small, italic, etc.) as needed
