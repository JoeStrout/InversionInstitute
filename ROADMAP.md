# Inversion Institute Roadmap
## or, "Things to Do List"

### Editor
- add work boundaries/margins, which the user can drag in to get a more compact space (determining position on the world-result histogram)
- make zoom (scroll wheel) either work, or disable it entirely
- BUG: the first time the Save As dialog comes up in the Free Play editor, there is some visual glitch where the preview area was in the Free Play screen.)

### Cut Scenes
- add fade in/out when transitioning to/from cut scenes

### Simulator

### Title & Options
- make a 48-point (or larger?) font for use as the Game Options and Free Play title


### General
- prepare additional fonts (small, italic, etc.) as needed
- improve or replace Georgia-24 font
- further improve the minimicro-pro fonts (shorten width of `'`, etc.)
- add sound effects and background music

### Script Notes
1. Introduction: meet Alicia; learn about crossings and not gates).
1. End of Recess: help a teacher signal his children to come back inside.  (Use a double-not gate to make a signal diode.)
1. Oarley's Children: Alicia tells of Ms. Oarley, who needs the night light to light up when either of her children request it, but neither should be able to turn it off if the other wants it on. (Two diodes feeding an OR gate.)
1. 0/1 Display: Make a 1-bit numeric display, shows 0 when input is low and 1 when it is high.
1. Andi's Gate: Meet Baab; help him make a circuit that opens Andi Anderson's gate when BOTH guards press their control pads. (2-input AND gate.)
1. Majority Rule: (Make a 3-input majority gate.)
1. (Make a latch with reset.)
1. Quiz Game: (4 inputs, latch the output for the first to go high and lock out all the others.)
1. (Make an XOR gate.)
1. (Make a half-adder, described as "count the input pins that are on and light up the appropriate (1 or 2) output pin.")
1. (Make a color mixer: inputs are Red, Green, and Blue, and outputs are the 7 possible combinations of those three inputs.)
1. (Make a 7-segment display that shows digits 0-7 in response to 3 inputs.)
